; UDPTL Configuration (UDPTL is one of the transports for T.38)
;
; NOTICE: Currently not including this file can result in Asterisk terminating.
;         There is no support yet for configuring this in FreePBX, that
;         functionality will come in the future when needed. The following are
;         the default settings. Changes should be made in the custom file.
;
; DEFAULTS:
;
; UDPTL start and UDPTL end configure start and end addresses
;
;  udptlstart=4000
;  udptlend=4999
;
; Whether to enable or disable UDP checksums on UDPTL traffic
;
;  udptlchecksums=no
;
; The number of error correction entries in a UDPTL packet
;
;  udptlfecentries = 3
;
; The span over which parity is calculated for FEC in a UDPTL packet
;
;  udptlfecspan = 3
;
; Some VoIP providers will only accept an offer with an even-numbered
; UDPTL port. Set this option so that Asterisk will only attempt to use
; even-numbered ports when negotiating T.38. Default is no.
;
;  use_even_ports = no
